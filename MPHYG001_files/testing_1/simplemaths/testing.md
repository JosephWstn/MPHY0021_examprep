How to use pytest for simplemaths
---------------------------------

This simplemaths.py file comes with a test file to test its functionality. 
To implement the tests, open a command line program (eg cmd for windows), navigate to this folder with simplemaths.py and testsimplemaths.py (using the "cd" function). Simply run the command "pytest", and the tests will be carried out.
If you do not have pytest, it should be able to be simply installed by typing "pip install pytest" into cmd.
